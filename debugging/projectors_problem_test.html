Problem: Certain straight lines (the z axis in this example) are not projected to straight lines when projecting the picture of a rotated cubecamera with the cube shader on a non-cube screen and viewing the screen from the ideal position using a perspective camera. Why? What am I getting wrong?

My understanding of the cube camera is that it consists of 6 perspective cameras with fov=90 and aspect=1, each aligned to a positive or negative main axis, to cover the whole space (between near and far). It can be positioned and rotated freely (and even scaled and skewed, I suppose), and then the generated images will account for this. The images are a CubeTexture, which is more or less just 6 square textures. The "cube size" in the parameters is the resolution of the square textures.

My understanding of the cube shader and of textureCube is that the vector supplied is treated as a direction only, and that the color is obtained by intersecting a ray in that direction (from the center) with the surface of the cube.

When positioning a perspective camera, my understanding is that the position of the camera is the eye position, not the projection plane position or something else.

With this in mind, I would expect that:
If the projection surface geometry covers the whole view of the observer (perspective) camera and the observer camera is positioned in the same origin as the cube shader uses,
then even if the cube camera is rotated,
the picture from the observer camera will be the same for every possible projection surface geometry (except for some minor sampling/aliasing artifacts). Only when the observer camera or cube shader origin were moved, I would expect differences caused by the geometry.
