<h1>Elias Hasle's fun experiments</h1>
<p>I am sharing some results of my playing around with @mrdoob's three.js and maybe other Javascript stuff.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="hooke_springs.html">Particles under influence of gravity, connected by springs that stretch and break</a></li>
<li><a href="tunnel.html">A very simple car driving simulator with procedurally generated graphics and optional gamepad control.</a></li>
</ul>
